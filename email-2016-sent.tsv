I'd like to opt out of having a guarantor, as both my parents currently reside abroad and do not have credit in the US. Please let me know specifically how I can pay the last two months' rent!  I will be back on campus by January 22 -- would it be okay for me bring a check to pay everything then?

We are still waiting on some projects and descriptions to be finalized, so this may not be a complete list, and I will let you know if it is updated. A preferences form will be released in class tomorrow. You will have a first choice preference, a second choice preference, and unlimited third choice preferences (i.e. a list of all remaining projects that you would have interest in.)  The class list has finally been updated, and students without CS accounts should have been notified.  *If you still are not in the cs132student group, or do not have a CS account, please email us immediately!* Finally, remember that we have a mandatory in-class lab tomorrow, in Metcalf. It is okay if you do not have a laptop as we will be working in groups.  Have a Happy Tuesday! =F0=9F=90=B8  John

I wanted to take another look at your handin before getting back to you. Firstly, the Good Code works with a baseline of 0 points, and every good point you get is a +1 and every bad code point is a -1. The maximum number of points you can get is 10, and the minimum is 0. You got 8 good code points and 3 bad code points, so the total is 5/10.  In your KDTree, your kNearestNeighbors and radiusSearch return PriorityQueues directly by calling the respective helper methods. These methods use one instance of PriorityQueue recursively, meaning they are mutable and can be modified. This is dangerous when somebody tries to change your pqueue from outside (using the pqueue you return from kNN and radius) in a malicious way. Therefore, it is good practice for you to return a copy of the pqueue instead (using .clone() maybe?). Hope that makes sense!  We have a test that checks if your kd tree runs correctly under a reasonable time frame with a normal sized data set and a double sized one that JJ provided us with. It seems like your program failed the test for the double sized data set, and this usually happens if your kd tree is extremely unbalanced and takes an extremely long time (the test usually takes ~10min). Sorry I can't provide any more detail since the test was provided to us and we don't have access to the actual code.  I hope that helped and definitely let me know if you have any other questions!

The Good Code score starts with a baseline of 0 rather than 10. Each good code point counts as +1 and each bad code point -1, with the maximum score you can get being 10 and the minimum 0. Since the sum of your good and bad code points (+4 and -9) is negative, your total was 0/10. Hope that helps! :)  And don't worry too much, people rarely get good scores for Good Code on the first project. You'll do much better on your next project!

Everything seems to be within our expected minimum functionalities except for adding professors' own categories. I'm not sure how accurate this abstract needs to be in terms of the actual final product, but we'll definitely try our best to get that functionality in!

Methods and algorithms pertaining to suggestion generation, such as Prefix and LED, should be contained somewhere else (maybe classes that implement a Generator interface?) and use the trie structure to get the information needed. Hope that makes sense!  I'm sorry I missed the unmodifiableMap in your code! I'll give you back one point for that. However, we do go by a pre-set list of Good/Bad Code points, which does not include anything about prefix tree right now. I understand you talked to a TA about this before the project was due, but I can't really take responsibility for that :( I'll definitely let the HTAs know about this and let you know if we decide to add a point for implementing a prefix tree, but for now, your grade will be updated to 92.

The maximum you can get is 10 points and minimum 0. Since you got 5 Good Code points (+5) and 4 Bad Code point deductions (-4), your final score is 1/10. Hope that helps!  Sure, I can probably meet you in the Fishbowl today at 5pm. Does that work for you?

As you pointed out, it will take an incredibly long time for your GUI to load for bacon.sqlite3, and for this same reason, you were asked to implement the graph algorithm dynamically.  You could perhaps have a different logic for the interface, such as simply asking the user for an actor or movie to add to the database and then checking if they already exist. Besides, we will most likely be using the full bacon.sqlite3 database copied into your ltmp for the update functionality. Hope that helps!

My student just emailed me again asked to add a point for this (apparently JJ said this should be a good code point during class today?). Should I just add a point to the spreadsheet and give him a point?

I understand that I should have written those methods elsewhere as they don=E2=80=99t really have to do wit= h the Trie.  As for the prefix tree implementation, we just went over Autocorrect in lecture today and both the slides and JJ mentioned that implementing a compact Trie (or prefix tree) was something that should be considered for a good code point. Any update on whether I can get at least a point for this?  Thanks, Sean (ss97)     On Mar 10, 2016, at 1:59 PM, Han, Katie <katie_han@brown.edu> wrote:  Hi Sean,  Your trie is a data structure that holds words in a tree-like structure; therefore, it should do no more than actually storing and spitting out the data. Methods and algorithms pertaining to suggestion generation, such as Prefix and LED, should be contained somewhere else (maybe classes that implement a Generator interface?) and use the trie structure to get the information needed. Hope that makes sense!  I'm sorry I missed the unmodifiableMap in your code! I'll give you back one point for that. However, we do go by a pre-set list of Good/Bad Code points, which does not include anything about prefix tree right now. I understand you talked to a TA about this before the project was due, but I can't really take responsibility for that :( I'll definitely let the HTAs know about this and let you know if we decide to add a point for implementing a prefix tree, but for now, your grade will be updated to 92.

I wanted to take another look at your code before getting back to you.  After looking at your code and discussing with other TAs, I've decided to give you back the mutable variable bad code point. In addition, I apologize for missing the containsAllElements test and the prefix tree implementation. I for some reason thought your trie stored the prefix of the entire word in your node. I gave you back two points for the test and got rid of the storing strings bad point as well.  More good news: after having multiple students ask for bonus points on implementing the space-optimizing prefix tree (as you did), we decided to add TWO good code points for it! I also noticed that you use ""assert"" in your code while going through your code a second time, and have added that good code point, too.  Here's what your Good Code breakdown looks like now:  -1 Instantiates parameter type using class rather than interface: HashMap<Character, Integer> table = new HashMap<>() rather than Map<...> t = new HashMap<>() -1 Not abstracting logic in main - main method is huge -2 Trie has code that doesn't fit with the data structure (suggestion generation, etc) +1 Good packaging +1 Class level comments +1 Function level comments +1 Inline comments +1 Uses joptsimple or other nice arg handling +1 Uses assert/some other equivalent +2 Implements space optimizing Trie (prefix tree)   This comes down to 4/10 for Good Code and 17/20 for Testing section, and you now have a 92/100 as your final grade.  Have a nice day!

I'm super excited to hear from you and to be working with you this summer on the Commerce team. To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a Korean American who spent most of my childhood in Seoul. I love watching movies, especially Pixar animations (or Disney, in the recent case of Zootopia!) and films with great visuals. In terms of programming, I too am very interested in full stack development, though I'm still exploring the different fields. I've definitely found coding and building software programs to be my favorite part of studying computer science.  I'm enjoying my (complimentary) Fitbit Charge HR a lot. I'm actually using my daily Fitbit data as a part of my term project for the Personal Informatics seminar I'm taking this semester. Hopefully I'll be able to tell you more interesting findings from the project by the beginning of the summer!  You mentioned that the team attacks various problems while working on the fulfillment process. Out of curiosity, could you please tell me more about some examples of these problems?

We are currently seeking other secure alternatives (since Professor Monica wants this app to be completed beyond the scope of this class) and are also thinking of implementing a simple log in system of our own as plan B.
